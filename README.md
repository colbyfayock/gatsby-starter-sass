# Gatsby Sass Starter

Jumpstart your next Gatsby project with the power of Sass!

## What This Includes
* [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/)
* [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/)
* [Sass](https://sass-lang.com)
* [React Helmet](https://github.com/nfl/react-helmet)
* [Resolve Src](https://github.com/alampros/gatsby-plugin-resolve-src)

## What This Doesn't Include
* A bunch of plugins that just complicate a quick bootstrap
* A bunch of components that you need to clean up
* Graphql that you don't need yet
* Stubbed files that you don't need yet
* Opinionated test and formatting setups (though both of these are encouraged)

# Getting Started

## Requirements
* [Gatsby CLI](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gatsby-cli)
* [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/)

## Quick Start
Run the following in your favorite terminal:
```
gatsby new [directory] https://github.com/colbyfayock/gatsby-starter-sass
```

## Starting from Scratch
* Set up Yarn: https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install/#mac-stable)[https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install/
* Install the Gatsby CLI globally:
```
yarn global add gatsby-cli
```
* Inside the directory of your choice, scaffold a new Gatsby site:
```
gatsby new [directory] https://github.com/colbyfayock/gatsby-starter-sass
```
For example, if I want my installation in `~/Code/new-gatsby-site`, I would navigate to `~/Code` and run:
```
gatsby new new-gatsby-site https://github.com/colbyfayock/gatsby-starter-sass
```
* Navigate to your new directory and run:
```
yarn develop
```
* You should now be running a new Gatsby site locally! 🎉
